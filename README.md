Create an Angular Single-Page-Application with two pages, Home Page and About us Page. The theme of the App 
should be a Tourist Agency (design example below).

The Home page should have a hero section with a Heading and short text. Additionally a button with a text of 
"Learn more". Under the Hero section in three columns and two rows display 6 different tourist destination with their 
names, price, number of nights and city.

When the user clicks on "Learn more" button redirect him to About us page, where you should display a few info about 
the company.
